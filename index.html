    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <a href="https://github.com/sovas0725">Shane Sova</a> and this is my second semester here at SWIC.</p>
    
    <p>My Interests are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Coding</li>
    <li>Baking/Cooking</li>
    <li>Gardening</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>Coding is my main passion, and is what I am looking to do as a career. I have a <a href="https://codehs.com/certifications/exam/fc2O5/view">Python Certification</a> from my high school, and also learned very basic C++ and JavaScript there, too. <br><br>
    I also know my way around HTML and CSS, as you may be able to see now.</p>

    <h2>Baking and Cooking</h2>
    <p>On the side, I like to make food for myself and my family. Some of these dishes include: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Chili (Very popular in our household in the colder months)</li> <br><img src="assets/chili.jpg" alt="Chili" width="300" height="400">
    <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies (Another cold-month favorite)</li> <br><img src="assets/cookies.jpg" alt="Chocolate Chip Cookies" width="300" height="200">
    <li>Beef Wellington (Made for the first time this past Christmas)</li> <br><img src="assets/beef_wellington.jpg" alt="Beef Wellington" width="300" height="400">
    </ul>

    <h2>Gardening</h2>
    <p>This mostly goes in hand with cooking, as I usually like to grow vegetables, fruits, and herbs and spices to use in cooking. Sometimes, however, I like to plant things just because they look nice. I usually stop by the Horticulture Club's plant sale in the spring to get more plants for the season.
