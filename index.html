      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is
        <a href="https://github.com/sovas0725">Shane Sova</a> and this is my
        second semester here at SWIC.
      </p>

      <p>My Interests are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Baking andCooking</li>
        <li>Gardening</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Coding is my main passion, and is what I am looking to do as a career. I
        have a
        <a href="https://codehs.com/certifications/exam/fc2O5/view"
          >Python Certification</a
        >
        from my high school, and also learned very basic C++ and JavaScript
        there, too. I also know my way around HTML and Tailwind, as you may be
        able to see now.
      </p>

      <h2>Baking and Cooking</h2>
      <p>
        On the side, I like to make food for myself and my family. Some of these
        dishes include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chili (Very popular in our household in the colder months)</li>
        <img
          src="assets/chili.jpg"
          alt="Chili"
          width="300"
          height="400"
          class="rounded-lg shadow-lg shadow-zinc-500"
        />
        <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies (Another cold-month favorite)</li>
        <img
          src="assets/cookies.jpg"
          alt="Chocolate Chip Cookies"
          width="300"
          height="200"
          class="rounded-lg shadow-lg shadow-zinc-500"
        />
        <li>Beef Wellington (Made for the first time this past Christmas)</li>
        <img
          src="assets/beef_wellington.jpg"
          alt="Beef Wellington"
          width="300"
          height="400"
          class="rounded-lg shadow-lg shadow-zinc-500m"
        />
      </ul>

      <h2>Gardening</h2>
      <p>
        This mostly goes in hand with cooking, as I usually like to grow
        vegetables, fruits, and herbs and spices to use in cooking. Sometimes,
        however, I like to plant things just because they look nice. I usually
        stop by the Horticulture Club's plant sale in the spring to get more
        plants for the season.
